# Johns Hopkins Covid 19 API

Using the data from the Repository located at: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19  
## Goal
The goal of this API is to provide quick and useful, up to date statistics on Covid-19 deaths, confirmed cases, and recovered cases by location.  

## TODO
Right now, the backend is set up ,I need to build an actual API around this data to serve it.
